# SensayHacks Development Progress

## Project Overview
SensayHacks is a Next.js application that showcases various AI concepts and prototypes, including MCP (Managed Compute Providers), Group Chat, Chatroom interfaces, and PureVoice technologies.

## Recent Accomplishments

### Concept Pages
1. **MCP Concept Page**
   - Updated to use a tabbed interface similar to the PureVoice concept page
   - Added tabs for Overview, Architecture, Implementation, and Examples
   - Fixed linting issues (removed unused GitBranch import)
   - Path: `src/app/prototypes/MCP-Concept/page.tsx`

2. **Group Chat Concept Page**
   - Created a new concept page with a tabbed interface
   - Implemented tabs for Overview, Scenarios, Dynamics, and Technical sections
   - Based on documentation from `documentation/concept-sensay-group-chat.md`
   - Path: `src/app/prototypes/GroupChat-Concept/page.tsx`

3. **Chatroom Concept Page**
   - Created a new concept page with a tabbed interface
   - Implemented tabs for Overview, Features, Interface, and Technical sections
   - Based on documentation from `documentation/concept-sensay-group-chat.md`
   - Path: `src/app/prototypes/Chatroom-Concept/page.tsx`

### Deployment Monitoring
1. **Vercel Deployment Monitor Enhancements**
   - Fixed infinite loop issue in the deployment monitor script
   - Improved status detection with case-insensitive regex matching
   - Added better debugging output to diagnose status detection issues
   - Modified the polling function to exit after detecting a successful deployment
   - Path: `monitor-deployment.js`

## Key Improvements to Deployment Monitor

### Status Detection
The deployment monitor now uses multiple strategies to detect deployment status:
- Direct regex pattern matching for "status ‚óè Ready" (case-insensitive)
- Fallback to line-by-line analysis of lines containing "status" and "ready"
- Proper return values from the monitoring function to signal success or failure

### Polling Loop
- Modified to exit after detecting a successful deployment
- Added a `deploymentSuccessful` flag to track when to exit the loop
- Improved error handling and logging

### Debug Logging
- Added comprehensive debug logging to help diagnose status detection issues
- Logs the full CLI output for analysis
- Reports the number of status lines found and their content

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Testing the Deployment Monitor**
   - Verify that the deployment monitor correctly detects deployment status
   - Confirm that it exits automatically after a successful deployment

2. **Additional Concept Pages**
   - Identify any remaining concept pages that need to be created
   - Ensure consistent styling and structure across all concept pages

### Future Enhancements
1. **UI Improvements**
   - Consider adding interactive demos to concept pages
   - Improve mobile responsiveness

2. **Deployment Process**
   - Further streamline the deployment monitoring process
   - Consider adding automated testing before deployment

## Technical Details

### Project Structure
- Next.js application with TypeScript
- Concept pages located in `src/app/prototypes/[ConceptName]/page.tsx`
- Documentation in `documentation/` directory
- Deployment monitoring script at root level (`monitor-deployment.js`)

### Key Dependencies
- Next.js 14.2.26
- React 18
- Lucide React for icons
- Radix UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### Deployment
- Deployed to Vercel
- Main branch automatically deploys to production
- Deployment monitoring script helps catch and diagnose build errors

## Command Reference

### Development
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Check TypeScript types
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### Deployment Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor deployment (will exit after successful deployment)
node monitor-deployment.js

# Monitor with Vercel API token (for better log access)
node monitor-deployment.js --token=YOUR_VERCEL_TOKEN

# Verify logs match what you see in Vercel dashboard
node monitor-deployment.js --verify
```

### Git Workflow
```bash
# Add changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Push changes (triggers deployment)
git push
```
