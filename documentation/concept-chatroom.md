## Enterprise Collaboration Scenario

"I need to figure out how to respond to Competitor X's new product launch. Let me delegate this to my strategy team."

Imagine a business leader who needs to develop a strategic response to a market disruption. Rather than consulting a single AI assistant, they create a working group of specialized Sensay replicas:

### The Team
- Market analysis expert
- Competitive intelligence specialist
- Product development strategist
- Financial modeling analyst

### The Process
1. Leader provides initial brief and key documents
2. Replicas work through the problem together
3. Each contributes their specialized expertise
4. Leader attends to other priorities
5. Receives notification when consensus is reached

### Key Benefits
- Richer problem exploration from multiple angles
- Knowledge synthesis across departmental boundaries
- Process improvement by identifying gaps and opportunities
- Institutional memory preserving complex reasoning chains
- 24/7 collaboration even when humans are offline
