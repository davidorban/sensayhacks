# Sensay Pure Voice

## Overview
Pure Voice represents the ultimate evolution of conversational AI interfaces - stripping away all visual elements, screens, and apps to create a seamless, natural voice-only interaction with your digital replica. By leveraging traditional telephone infrastructure alongside cutting-edge voice synthesis, Pure Voice enables your Sensay replica to call your phone directly or receive calls from any telephone, creating truly immersive and accessible conversations.

## Core Concept
The fundamental premise of Pure Voice is radical simplicity: **everything disappears except the voice**. This minimal interface eliminates barriers to engagement and creates a more natural, human-like interaction with your digital replica - available anywhere with telephone service, regardless of smartphone access or technical proficiency.

## Technical Architecture

### Integration Components
- **Twilio Integration**: Telephone network connectivity and call management
- **ElevenLabs Conversational AI**: High-fidelity, emotionally nuanced voice synthesis
- **Sensay Replica Backend**: Conversation intelligence and persona management
- **Call Scheduling System**: Time-based trigger mechanism for outbound calls

### Call Flow - Outbound (Replica to Human)
1. Scheduled trigger or API request initiates call sequence
2. Sensay platform prepares replica context and conversation parameters
3. Twilio places outbound call to specified telephone number
4. Upon answer, ElevenLabs synthesizes replica voice in real-time
5. Conversation audio is processed bidirectionally
6. Call recording (optional) is stored in the user's Sensay account

### Call Flow - Inbound (Human to Replica)
1. User dials dedicated phone number associated with their replica
2. Twilio routes call to Sensay platform
3. Authentication occurs via caller ID or phone-based verification
4. Sensay loads appropriate replica profile and context
5. ElevenLabs manages voice synthesis for natural conversation
6. Call continues until user terminates or scheduled end
