# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Concept

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized approach for AI models to request and receive context during inference, enabling dynamic context acquisition rather than requiring upfront context provision.

## Core Concept

### Dynamic Context
- On-demand information requests
- Reduced token usage
- Improved efficiency
- Context-aware responses

### Standardized Protocol
- Consistent interface
- Model-agnostic communication
- External system integration
- Standardized context requests

### Tool Integration
- External tool access
- Data source integration
- Expanded capabilities
- Seamless workflow

## Key Benefits

### For Models
- Reduced token usage
- Improved performance
- Better context access
- Standardized communication

### For Systems
- Enhanced security
- Flexible integration
- Standardized approach
- Improved efficiency

### For Users
- More relevant responses
- Better context awareness
- Reduced overhead
- Improved accuracy
