I'd be happy to brainstorm how to implement MCP (Model Control Protocol) for Sensay so that the API can be invoked through this protocol rather than traditional API calls.

## MCP for Sensay: Implementation Concept

Looking at the Sensay API specification and considering Anthropic's MCP approach, here's how we could implement an MCP interface for Sensay:

### 1. MCP Client/Server Architecture

The MCP implementation would consist of:

- **MCP Server**: A middleware layer that sits between client applications and the Sensay API
- **MCP Client**: Libraries for different languages that developers can use to interact with Sensay through the MCP protocol

### 2. Core Components

**MCP Protocol Definition**:
- Define a structured JSON schema for MCP messages to/from Sensay
- Messages would include: action type, parameters, authentication tokens, and metadata

**Tool Registry**:
- Register Sensay API endpoints as "tools" that can be invoked via MCP
- Map Sensay endpoints to tool definitions with parameters and expected responses

**Execution Engine**:
- Handles routing MCP commands to appropriate Sensay API endpoints
- Manages authentication token handling and session persistence

### 3. Message Flow

```
Client App → MCP Client → MCP Server → Sensay API
                                     ↓
Client App ← MCP Client ← MCP Server ← Sensay API
```

### 4. Tool Definition Example

Here's how a Sensay API endpoint could be defined as an MCP tool:

```json
{
  "tool_name": "replica_chat_completion",
  "description": "Get a completion response from a replica",
  "parameters": {
    "replicaUUID": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "uuid",
      "description": "The UUID of the replica to chat with"
    },
    "content": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Message content to send to the replica"
    },
    "source": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["discord", "telegram", "embed", "web", "telegram_autopilot"],
      "default": "web"
    },
    "skip_chat_history": {
      "type": "boolean",
      "default": false
    }
  },
  "returns": {
    "content": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The replica's response"
    }
  },
  "endpoint": "/v1/replicas/{replicaUUID}/chat/completions"
}
```

### 5. Authentication Integration

- MCP sessions would maintain Sensay authentication (JWT or Organization Service Token)
- Security layer would handle token refresh and validation

### 6. Specialized MCP Commands for Sensay

Beyond simple API mapping, we could add Sensay-specific MCP commands:

1. **Replica Discovery**: `find_replica` - Search for replicas by tags, name, or other criteria
2. **Multi-Replica Chat**: `start_group_chat` - Initiate a conversation with multiple replicas
3. **Memory Management**: `manage_memory` - Interact with a replica's knowledge/memory
4. **Content Generation Pipeline**: Chain multiple Sensay API calls in a single MCP command

### 7. Sample MCP Request

```json
{
  "command": "execute_tool",
  "tool": "replica_chat_completion",
  "parameters": {
    "replicaUUID": "03db5651-cb61-4bdf-9ef0-89561f7c9c53",
    "content": "How can you help me with dementia care?",
    "source": "web"
  },
  "auth": {
    "type": "bearer",
    "token": "jwt_token_here"
  }
}
```

### 8. Chain of Tools Example

One powerful MCP feature would be chaining Sensay operations:

```json
{
  "command": "execute_chain",
  "chain": [
    {
      "tool": "find_replica",
      "parameters": { "tags": ["Healthcare", "Dementia"] },
      "output_map": { "items[0].uuid": "replicaUUID" }
    },
    {
      "tool": "replica_chat_completion",
      "parameters": {
        "replicaUUID": "${replicaUUID}",
        "content": "What's your experience with memory care?"
      },
      "output_map": { "content": "response" }
    },
    {
      "tool": "summarize_response",
      "parameters": { "text": "${response}" }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 9. Implementation Phases

1. **Core API Mapping**: Basic translation of REST endpoints to MCP tools
2. **Extended Capabilities**: Add Sensay-specific MCP commands and chaining
3. **SDK Development**: Create language-specific clients (JavaScript, Python, etc.)
4. **Plugin System**: Allow third-party extensions to the MCP toolset

### 10. Benefits for Developers

- **Simplified Integration**: One consistent interface for all Sensay capabilities
- **Composability**: Chain operations without multiple API calls
- **Contextual Awareness**: MCP maintains state between commands
- **Cross-platform Consistency**: Same MCP protocol works in any environment

This approach would make Sensay's powerful replica capabilities more accessible through the MCP paradigm while maintaining the robustness of the existing API infrastructure.
