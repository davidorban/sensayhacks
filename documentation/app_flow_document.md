# App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
When a brand-new user first accesses the application they are greeted by a clean landing page. This page offers clear options for signing up or logging in. For the sign-up process, a user enters their email address and a password through the Supabase Auth interface. If an existing user visits the site, they simply choose the log in option and enter their credentials. In addition, the system provides functionality to recover a lost password by clicking a link that starts a secure password reset process. There is no ambiguity here since both email/password registration and login are clearly presented. Users are guided step-by-step and have access to all necessary instructions for each process.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
Upon successful authentication, the application displays a dual-pane layout that serves as the main dashboard. On the left side of the screen a persistent vertical sidebar is visible and remains fixed as the user navigates through the app. The sidebar lists the seven prototype ideas in a clear and intuitive manner, making it easy to see which section is active by visually highlighting the current selection. The main content area on the right dynamically displays the UI for the chosen prototype. This design keeps the top level navigation and the interface elements consistent, ensuring that users can move seamlessly from the dashboard to the detailed views of each idea.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
Once the user selects a specific prototype from the sidebar, the main content area transitions to show the detailed interface for that feature. For the Replica Task Memory prototype, the user is presented with a text input area to enter messages to their replica. A send button is available which, upon clicking, appends the user message to a chronologically ordered conversation display. Each message appears with a clear timestamp and a sender label. Also present on this page is an additional section that displays a list of tasks extracted from the conversation. When switching to the Pure Voice prototype view, the user finds a large button labeled with "Start Mock Voice Interaction". Activating this button starts a simulation of a voice-driven exchange. The interface then updates to show placeholder text mimicking a voice interaction with clear indications that this is a simulated demo.

Moving on to the MCP Client/Server workflow view, the user encounters a simple form comprised of clearly labeled fields such as for source data, process type, and priority level. A dedicated button (for example, titled "Process Request") initiates the workflow with backend processing handled through a mocked Sensay API integration. The results are then displayed in a clear format which might take the shape of a structured report, complete with status indicators that show the progress of the process. In the Token-Gated Memories view, the user sees a list of replica memories in the interface. Some memories are clearly marked as locked, and a button labeled "Unlock (Mock)" is visible next to them. When the user clicks this button, the application simulates a token payment and then the locked memory is revealed. Similarly, in the Token-Guided Evolution view, the current evolution level of the replica is shown along with details like "Evolution Level: 1". A button labeled "Evolve (Mock $SNSY Payment)" triggers a simulated process that updates the replica's level and displays mock NFT information. In the Bonding Replicas interface, the user sees whether the replica is bonded or not. A button labeled "Toggle Mock Bond (Simulate Payment)" is available and when activated, the bonding status changes visibly in the UI. Finally, the Chatroom prototype provides an interface where multiple predefined replicas are involved. Users can input an initial seed prompt and click on the "Start Replica Chat" button, after which the application orchestrates the conversation between the replicas. Each message in the transcript is clearly differentiated by labels and timestamps which make it easy to follow the conversation. All transitions between these pages are smooth and designed to maintain a consistent layout with the sidebar remaining constant on the left edge of the screen throughout all these interactive flows.

## Settings and Account Management
Users have access to a dedicated section for managing their account settings. This area allows them to update personal information such as email addresses or passwords and to configure various user preferences including notification settings. Should the application include billing or subscription settings as part of the prototype, these settings are available in the same area, ensuring that all personal and account management actions are done in one consistent environment. After completing any changes, users have a clear option to return to the main navigation area so they can continue exploring the different prototype pages with ease while maintaining a consistent user experience.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
If a user enters invalid data, such as an incorrect password format during sign up or mismatched credentials during login, the system immediately displays a clear error message indicating what went wrong and how to correct the issue. In situations where connectivity is lost, such as during an API call to the Sensay interface or during a simulated token interaction, the UI displays an error state with an option to retry the operation. Any attempt to access restricted or non-existent features also results in a fallback page that briefly explains that the desired action cannot be performed. These error messages and fallback states are designed to be non-disruptive, providing a smooth path for the user to return to the normal flow of the application.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
From beginning to end, the application provides a seamless journey that starts at the landing page with clear options for sign up and login using Supabase Auth. Once authenticated, users enter a centralized dashboard where a persistent vertical sidebar helps them navigate between seven distinct prototype views. Whether interacting with a conversation interface in the Replica Task Memory feature, simulating a voice interaction in Pure Voice, processing data in the MCP workflow, or engaging in token simulations through unlocking memories, evolving replicas, or bonding interactions, every user action is met with clear, real-time visual feedback. Account management and settings are easily accessible, and thoughtful error handling ensures that users are always aware of what is happening and how to correct any missteps. Overall, the design ensures that users, judges, developers, and potential collaborators alike can easily understand the functionality of each prototype as they explore the integrated and consistent interface built for the Sensay Hackathon.
