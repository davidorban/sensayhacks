# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Demo Script (2 Minutes)

## Introduction (15 seconds)
"Welcome to the MCP demo. This protocol enables AI models to dynamically request and receive context during inference, making interactions more efficient and context-aware."

## Demonstration (1:15)

### 1. Initial Setup (30 seconds)
- "Let's create a model that needs to access external data."
- "I'll show how it can request context in real-time."
- "This reduces the need for upfront context provision."

### 2. Dynamic Context (30 seconds)
- "Let's see how the model requests information on-demand."
- "It will query an external knowledge base."
- "This reduces token usage and improves efficiency."

### 3. Tool Integration (30 seconds)
- "Let's demonstrate integration with external tools."
- "The model will access a specialized database."
- "This expands its capabilities without direct integration."

### 4. Standardized Protocol (30 seconds)
- "Let's see how different models can use the same protocol."
- "I'll switch between models while maintaining context."
- "This shows the standardized communication approach."

## Conclusion (30 seconds)
"This demo showcases how MCP can:
- Enable dynamic context acquisition
- Reduce token usage
- Expand model capabilities
- Standardize AI communication

The concept has wide-ranging applications in enterprise solutions, research, and customer support."

## Key Points to Emphasize
- Dynamic context requests
- Reduced token usage
- Standardized communication
- Expanded capabilities
